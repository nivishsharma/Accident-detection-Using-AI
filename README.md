Use of AI for realtime detection of car crashes and timely dispatch of assistance , We have trained the AI by thousands of crashed car pictures so it can accurately detect accidents . 
Sample images for testing the detection accuracy and speed of the trained model. These images were not part ofthe training model and are completely new to the AI.
